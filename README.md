Code for quantitatively analyzing the metaphors dataset. We first removed potentially AI-generated responses in `removing_ai_generated_responses.ipynb`. We identified dominant metaphors using `topic_modeling.ipynb`. Then, we measured implicit perceptions of warmth, competence, and anthropomorphism using `warmth_competence.ipynb` and `get_anthroscore.py` following the approaches of [1] and [2]. Finally, we performed stepwise regressions to predict trust and adoption using `stepwise_regressions.ipynb`.
